I wasn't sure what foldl and foldr stand for or what they do.  

Lessons:  
• `reversed()` actually gives you a `<list_reverseiterator object>`, not a list
• folding is an functional programming pattern similar to reducing  
• it requires an operation, accumulated (starting) value and a data structure to fold (array, tree etc)  
• it can be a fold (random order), left fold (starting from beginning of data structure) or right fold (starts from end)
