Conclusions from looking at test cases:  

• pitches in a scale are separated from each other by half-steps  
• half-step means "jump to next (adjacent) pitch"  
• whole step means "jump two half-steps (to the pitch after the next adjacent one)"  
• the parameter to the `interval` method can be seen as a way of traversing the list of notes  
• the scale is circular - i.e. first note in list follows last note in list  


Lessons:  
• `str.capitalize()` can be used to capitalize first character in string
