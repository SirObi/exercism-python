**Large numbers**  
I was wondering whether casting the number as str to get individual digits and then doing modulo over the (way smaller) sum of the digits will be faster (using the trick they taught us at primary school about a number being divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3).  
The answer is: definitely not.    
```python
modulo = "'Pling' if 29842947823468436 % 3 == 0 else ''"

cast_and_sum = "'Pling' if sum(int(s) for s in str(29842947823468436)) % 3 == 0 else ''"

print("modulo:", timeit.timeit(modulo))
print("cast and sum:", timeit.timeit(cast_and_sum))
```  

```
modulo: 0.031004979999999994  
cast and sum: 4.305835275000001
```
Modulo is over 100x faster


Exercism user betegelse has implemented this in the following way:  
```python

drops = ((3,'Pling'), (5,'Plang'), (7,'Plong'))

def raindrops(n):
	"""Converts a number to a string according to the raindrop sounds."""

	speak = [s for f, s in drops if n % f == 0]
	return "".join(speak) if speak else str(n)
```  
This solution is more DRY and allows for adding additional use cases with minimal effort.

**Lessons**  
â€¢ whenever you see you're **repeating code**, ask yourself whether there exists a **functional-programming solution** (like a map, or list comprehension, in Python's case)
